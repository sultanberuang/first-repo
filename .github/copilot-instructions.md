# Copilot Instructions for Python Test Drive Project

## Project Overview
This is a minimal Python project consisting of a single script file `test_drive.py` intended for testing and experimenting with Python code snippets.

## Key Files
- `test_drive.py`: The main file where all code resides. Currently empty, serving as a starting point for Python development.

## Development Practices
- Execute code directly using `python test_drive.py` from the project root.
- No dependencies or build steps are currently configured.
- Add imports, functions, and logic directly in `test_drive.py` as needed for testing purposes.

## Coding Conventions
- As the project is in its initial state, follow standard Python conventions (PEP 8) until specific patterns emerge.
- Use descriptive variable and function names for clarity in experimental code.

## Workflow Tips
- Use the file for quick prototyping and validation of Python concepts.
- Expand the project structure (e.g., add modules, tests) as the codebase grows beyond simple testing.
